                  <p>This week for the team activity we worked on some more Javascript challenges. With out Teammates we were able to make a variety of things print to the console via tables and other methods. Over all this was a fun assignment anf I enjoyed it.</p>
                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <ol>
                  <h5>Chapter 5: Objects</h5>
                    <li>Function = method</li>
                    <li>Object literal – object that is created directly in language wrapping all properties and methods in curly braces</li>
                    <li>Usually will be const</li>
                    <li>Accessing properties – superman.name, superman[‘name’]</li>
                    <li>hasOwnProperty() method – checks object for properties</li>

                  <h5>Chapter 6: Document Object Model (DOM)</h5>
                    <li>allows access to elements of web page</li>
                    <li>.nodeType helps you find out what type of node it is</li>
                    <li>Query selectors allows you to use css notation to find first element in document that matches selector</li>
                    <li>InnerHTML returns all child elements of element string</li>
                    <li>Live collections – getElementsByClassName(), update to reflect any changes on page</li>

                  <h5>chapter 7</h5>
                    <li>Event listener – sends an alert when something happens</li>
                    <li>.addEvenListener(“click”,  doSomething);</li>
                    <li>Can be called without node</li>
                    <li>Inline – onClick</li>
                    <li>Target property – returns reference to node</li>
                    <li>Events can include – mouse, keyboard, modifier keys, touch</li>
                    <li>.removeEventListener(‘click’, remove)</li>

                  <h4>Object oriented Programming has 3 main concepts</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Encapsulation - Part of the program are inside objects and only essental functionalities are oxposed to the end user.</li>
                <li>Polymorphism - The same process to be used for different objects. Various objects can be used for the same method.</li>
                <li>inheritance - You can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properites and methods.</li>

                  <h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>
                <p>This week we learned about testing and debuggin in javascript. There are different
                  tpyes of errors which will determine how we go about the process. Here are the types
                  of errors you can encounter:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Syntax Errors - errors that are detected by the compiler</li>
                    <li>Runtime Errors - errors that cause a program to terminate abnormally</li>
                    <li>Logic Errors - occer when a program does not perform the way it was intended to</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    It's important to be able to recognize what errors we have so that we can properly
                    test and debug them.
                </p>
                <h4>Concole.log()</h4>
                <p>
                    One debugging method is <i>console.log()</i>. Using this allows us to display a value in
                    the console so we can see what value is being claculated and can see if it's our desired outcome.</p>
                <p>
                    a = 5; <br>
                    b = 6; <br>
                    c = a + b; <br>
                    console.log(c); <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    By doing this we will see that c is equal to 11 and and know whether or not our program is working
                    correctly.
                </p>
                <h4>Breakpoints</h4>
                <p>
                    Another method is by setting breakpoints. We can set breakpoints and when our code runs into one,
                    it will stop executing and we can see the current values. We can then resume the program.
                </p>
                <h4>Debugger Keyword</h4>
                <p>
                    The <i>debugger</i> keyword is similar to settting a breakpoint. It stops the execution of
                    the program where it is placed before continuing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    var x = 15 * 5; <br>
                    debugger; <br>
                    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
                </p>

                  <h2>AJAX</h2>
                  <p>W3Schools says that AJAX is a developer's dream for these reasons:</p>
                  <ol>
                      <li>It can update a web page without reloading the page</li>
                      <li>Request data from a server - after the page has loaded</li>
                      <li>Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded</li>
                      <li>Send data to a server - in the background</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>AJAX stands for Aynchronous JavaScript And XML <br>
                  There are 7 steps to on how AJAX works:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                      <li>An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)</li>
                      <li>An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript</li>
                      <li>The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server</li>
                      <li>The server processes the request</li>
                      <li>The server sends a response back to the web page</li>
                      <li>The response is read by JavaScript</li>
                      <li>Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript</li>
                  </ol>
                </div>
              </section> 

              <section class="week-8">
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 8: Summary & Notes</button>
                <div class="content">
                  <p>
                    CSS transitions allow you to animate something that may typically happen immediately.
                    You can customize how it is animated and for how long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you want a button to change color when you hover over it, you can.
                    Below is the code to do that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    div { <br>
                    width: 100px; <br>
                    height: 100px; <br>
                    color: red; <br>
                    transition: color 2s; <br>
                    } <br>
        
                    div:hover { <br>
                        color: blue; <br>
                      }
                </p>
                <p>
                    We first target the div in order to style it and give it a red color.
                    When we target it again but use the :hover, it makes it transition to blue
                    when the user hovers over it. The transition also has a clarification of 2s
                    so that the transition happens over a span of 2 seconds.
                </p>
                </div>
              </section>

              <section class="week-9">
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 9: Summary & Notes</button>
                <div class="content">
                  <h3>The Window Object</h3>
        <p>
            It is supported by all browsers and represents the browser's window. Global Javascript functions, variables
            and onjects automatically become members of the window object. There are also window object methods. One that
            is commonly used is the alert() method. It displays an alert box with a message and an ok button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click <button onclick="sendAlert()">HERE</button> to see an example.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code is simple: <br>
            function sendAlert() { <br>
                alert("This is an alert() method!"); <br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>
            Another method is the scrollTo() method. This allows you to have the page take you to a specified
            destination on the window.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click <button onclick="scrollBottom()">HERE</button> to try the scrollTo() method.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the code for the two functions to make the scrollTo() methods work: <br>
            function scrollBottom() { <br>
                window.scrollTo(0,5000); <br>
            } <br>
            <br>
            function scrollBack() { <br>
                window.scrollTo(0,50); <br>
            }
        </p>
                </div>
              </section>
            </div>
            <div id="table-of-content">
